Data vs Information

In an NHL statistics database the
data stored would be the raw stats
that the players aquire through their
games. The information that is developed
from this data is things such as rankings, 
per game averages, and provides comparisons 
for players within the league. The numbers of 
goals assists and points are not relevant 
without comparison to other players, and shown
in contrast within others in the league through
player statistic rankings. Once the numbers of 
the data are givin context throughout the NHL, 
the information is used to make predictions and
provide insight on player and team matchups.
