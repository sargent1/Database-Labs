Data Models 

The Hierarchical pre-relational data model is
structured in a way that there is a main data 
point at the top of the heirarchy that stems
down to other points within it. Each part of 
the heirarchy doesn't connect with eachother,
but stems only from the point previous. Nework
models are similarily structured, but have 
interconnected points within the structure. XML
is a good model for data storage because it
allows for the data to be queried, expoerted, 
and serialized into the desired format.
